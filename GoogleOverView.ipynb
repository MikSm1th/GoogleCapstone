    "I've been interested in computer programming and data science as a hobby for a few years. I have used my skills to automate repetitive tasks in my professional workflow, and to inform fantasy sports decisions. Sometimes I wonder if the skills that I have developed while pursuing this hobby have value in the job market. I took the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate to answer this question. "

To that end I will simply offer the coding components of the solution. If anyone reading this is interested in a more through deep dive into communication skills, feel free to reach out. "
